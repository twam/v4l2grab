v4l2grab
========

This is a small command line utility for grabbing JPEGs form V4L2 devices (e.g. USB webcams).

For installation, follow the instructions into the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/twam/v4l2grab/wiki/Installation).

Try `./v4l2grab -h` or just `v4l2grab` if you have installed it to get some help.

If your webcam works, please add it to the [Compatible Devices](https://github.com/twam/v4l2grab/wiki/Compatible%20Devices) table.
